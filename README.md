# Time-Series-Forecasting---Group-Assignment

I took the lead on this project, where we used R programming analyzed Coca Cola's quarterly earnings over 16 years with the goal being to find valid 2 valid linear models and compare their errors to determine the best model.
We used these models to project their future sales for the next 4 periods (1 year).

Various approaches were attempted. For example:
1. Applying seasonal ARIMA model ("SARIMA") to account for seasonality in Coca Cola earnings
2. Applying the stastistical Box Test to check for correlation
3. Determining if it's White Noise or Great White Noise, in order to determine if it's a valid model

Ultimately we found 3 valid models for predicting future Coca-Cola earnings, which which MAPE error scores were calculated.
